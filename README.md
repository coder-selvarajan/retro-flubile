# Retro Flubile

It's a Flutter based app to give you an immersive experience of retro tech. It has two parts. In the first part we dive back into the phone released more than 10 years ago and feel the power of olden tech and in second part, we are going to experience retro Android OS(Ice Cream Sandwich) navigations which is almost everyone's first Android OS experience. 

Here are some screenshots:
